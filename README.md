This is the osprey webpage app.

This is a project by Jason Puls for creating an app for a webpage of
mine.  I know that there are a number of webpage sources like wordpress
but I wanted to make one from scratch.  Initially I wrote a parser and
my own custom markdown format but later switched to the quill text
editor for writing custom pages.  The admininistration of the site was
designed to allow anyone with or without programming knowledge to manage
the site.
The backend is written in python using the Flask framework.  OpenSql is
used for the database.

For setting up run setup.py and it will create the necessary tables for
the database.
